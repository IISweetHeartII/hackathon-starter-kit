# Hackathon Playbook

## 0. Before Start

- Align on one measurable success metric
- Define scope to MVP only

## 1. First 6 Hours

- Finalize problem statement and user flow
- Lock core feature list (must-have only)
- Prepare architecture sketch and API contracts

## 2. Build Window

- FE/BE/AI work in parallel with fixed sync times
- Keep a single source of truth for tasks
- Freeze non-critical feature requests early

## 3. Demo Prep

- Build one deterministic happy-path demo
- Record backup demo video
- Prepare short pitch: problem -> solution -> result

## 4. Submission

- Verify repo contains README, run steps, and architecture note
- Verify no secrets in code/history
- Tag release commit for final submission
